UMR v0.2  --  Unreal Media Ripper

This utility rips Music and Sound class objects from .umx and .uax files in
Unreal or Unreal Tournament.  It rips all the exports in the file that it
understands (currently 'xm', 'it', 's3m', and 'WAV').  Adding support for an
export is fairly trivial, so you can add them in a minute or two.

I'm hoping to extend this to be able to rip anything from Unreal [Tournament]'s
data files.  Unfortunantly, the filespec isn't documented very well.  Tim
Sweeney has posted a page that describes the filespec, but that page is in
error.  I spent a pretty good amount of time getting the format figured out.

Currently, AFAIK, there are 5 file header versions in Unreal.  61, 62, 64,
66, and 68.  They all have slightly different attributes, and store things
differently than the others.  See unrealfmt.c, urf.h, and unrealfmtdata.c for
details.

If you have any suggestions/changes, feel free to email them to me.  I'm
hoping to have 1.0 understand all the unreal data files.
